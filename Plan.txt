This is where we can write how we want to do this

Plan:

Have LinkedHashMaps for inserting, deleting, removing so it is O(1) time
There is no way to sort this as a list

Arrays for sorting so we can save the data in an order
Bad for inserting and deleting (O(n)), but good for sorting
Plan is to wait to update changes to the arrays until the user actually wants to sort items. Then fix them and once they are fixed ask how they want the items presented.
This means technically inserting and deleting is O(1) time because that is easy for hashmaps but in the background will take O(n) when we fix the arrays
